**Sticky Rice with Mango (Khao Niew Mamuang)**

*Sticky Rice with Mango is a classic Thai dessert known for its delightful combination of sweet, sticky rice and fresh, ripe mango. Here's how you can make it at home.*

**Ingredients:**

*For the Sticky Rice:*
- 1 cup glutinous rice (also known as sticky rice)
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

*For the Mango Topping:*
- 2 ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and sliced
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)

**Instructions:**

**Preparing the Sticky Rice:**

1. **Rinse the Rice:** Place the glutinous rice in a large bowl and cover it with cold water. Gently agitate the rice with your hand to wash away excess starch. Drain the water. Repeat this process 2-3 times until the water runs clear.

2. **Soak the Rice:** Add enough water to the rinsed rice to cover it, and let it soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours. This step allows the rice to absorb moisture and cook evenly.

3. **Steam the Rice:** After soaking, drain the rice. Place the rice in a steamer lined with a muslin cloth or cheesecloth. Steam the rice over boiling water for about 30-40 minutes or until it's tender and cooked through. You can also use a rice cooker with a steaming function.

4. **Make the Sweet Coconut Sauce:** While the rice is steaming, prepare the sweet coconut sauce. In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Heat it over medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar is fully dissolved. Remove it from the heat once done.

5. **Mix the Rice and Sauce:** Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a mixing bowl. Pour about 3/4 of the sweet coconut sauce over the cooked rice. Gently fold and mix the sauce into the rice until it's well coated. The rice should have a sticky, slightly sweet, and creamy texture.

**Assembling the Dessert:**

1. **Serve the Rice:** To serve, take a small cup or bowl and place a portion of sticky rice on one side.

2. **Add Mango Slices:** Arrange slices of ripe mango next to the sticky rice on the plate.

3. **Drizzle with Sauce:** Drizzle the remaining sweet coconut sauce over the mango and the sticky rice.

4. **Garnish (Optional):** You can garnish your dessert with toasted sesame seeds or mung beans, but this is optional.

5. **Serve Warm:** Sticky Rice with Mango is best enjoyed warm. It's a delightful combination of warm, sticky rice, and the cool, sweet mango.
